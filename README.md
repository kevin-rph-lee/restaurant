# Midterm Project
A two page full-stack food ordering experience for a single restaurant., select one or more dishes and place an order for pick-up. When an order is placed the restaurant receives the order via SMS. The restaurant can specify how long it will take to fulfill it. Once they provide this information, the website updates for the customer and also notifies them via SMS. The restaurant owner also has the ability to update the price of menu items via SMS.
